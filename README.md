# Scientific-Programming---Project

My project is craeting a local website in which you can get movie recommendations based on the genre and characteristics of a movie title selected. For this I am using the csv file called IMDB-Movie-Data, which is a dataset from which I get the movies for the recommendations. I found this data set in a GitHub repository of which I leave the link below so anyone who wants to go check it out can do so, it is quite nice because they have tips and resources to learn about Data Science. The recommendations are going to be made by a Content-based filtering, so basically based on the user's taste in movies the system recommends similar movies that they might like.

Link to the dataset: https://github.com/LearnDataSci/articles/blob/master/Python%20Pandas%20Tutorial%20A%20Complete%20Introduction%20for%20Beginners/IMDB-Movie-Data.csv

This dataset has 12 columns and 1000 rows.

For the app interface, I am using Streamlit which Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python, and no frontâ€‘end experience required.
